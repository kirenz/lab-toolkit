## Basics

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a provider of internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. We will use GitHub as a platform for web hosting and collaboration.

Git is a version control system -- like the “Track Changes” features from Microsoft Word with many more additional features.

- Git can be used to store content 
- Code can be changed and other developers can add code in parallel.
- Git has a remote repository which is stored in a server and a local repository which is stored in the computer of each developer.
