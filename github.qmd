# Basics

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is a provider of internet hosting for software development and version control using Git. We will use GitHub as a platform for web hosting and collaboration.

:::

Git is a version control system -- like the "Track Changes" features from Microsoft Word with many more additional features:

:::

- Git can be used to store content 
- Code can be changed and other developers can add code in parallel.
- Git has a remote repository which is stored in a server and a local repository which is stored in the computer of each developer.

# Create account

You need a free GitHub-account for our course. Please follow the instructions below (*in case you already have a GitHub account: please add your HdM-email address to your account*):

::: {.callout-important}
## To do

- [Create a GitHub account with your HdM-email](https://github.com/join)
- Verify your GitHub email
- You may also sign up for the free [student developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack)  
- Install the [VS Code GitHub extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/github)

# Use .gitignore 

You should use a `.gitignore` file in your repository's root directory to tell Git which files and directories to ignore when you make a commit. This means that these files will only exist on your local machine and not in your remote GitHub repository. For example, we don't want to commit our API-keys stored in `.env` to our remote GitHub repository.

::: {.callout-important}
## To do

- [Download this .gitignore template](/.gitignore)
- Place the file in your repository's root directory
- Rename the file to `.gitignore`

### GitHub SSH Key

Using the SSH protocol, you can connect and authenticate to remote servers and services from your terminal. With SSH keys, you can connect to GitHub without supplying your username and personal access token at each visit.

1. [Check for existing SSH keys](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/checking-for-existing-ssh-keys)
1. [Generate a SSH-Key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
1. [Add a new SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
1. [Test connection](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/testing-your-ssh-connection)

## GitHub Projects

A project is an adaptable spreadsheet, task-board, and road map that integrates with your issues and pull requests on GitHub to help you plan and track your work effectively. 

You can create and customize multiple views by filtering, sorting, grouping your issues and pull requests, visualize work with configurable charts, and add custom fields to track metadata specific to your team. 

Learn how you can use GitHub Issues to plan and track your work:
