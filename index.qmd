If you aren't familiar with the command line, you should first take a look at this [short introduction](/cli.qmd)
:::

This toolkit covers how to:

- Set up a [Python](/python.qmd) devolopment environment (we use Anaconda and Visual Studio Code)
- Prepare a [working environment](/environments.qmd) (create folders and --if necessary-- obtain API keys and create a `.env` file) 
- Create a [GitHub](/github.qmd) account for software development and version control
- Install a [SQL](/sql.qmd) environment with a *MySQL database* and *MySQL Workbench*
- Make yourself familiar with the [slide toolkit](/slide.qmd)

Please read all the relevant instructions and complete the tasks listed in the sections.
