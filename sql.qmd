## Basics

SQL (Structured Query Language, pronounced "S-Q-L" or sometimes "Sequel") is a standardized database language specifically used for managing and manipulating relational databases. 

Through SQL, users can create, retrieve, update, and delete data, as well as design and manage database structures. Widely adopted across various database systems, SQL serves as the foundation for many modern data operations and applications.


## MySQL

MySQL (pronounced "My S-Q-L" or sometimes "My Sequel") is a powerful open-source relational database management system (RDBMS). 

It uses a structured query language (SQL) to manage, manipulate, and retrieve data stored in relational databases.
