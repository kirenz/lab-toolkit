# Basics

Most of the slides are made with the open source scientific and technical publishing system [Quarto](https://quarto.org/) and [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/).

`reveal.js` is an open source HTML presentation framework. It's a tool that enables anyone with a web browser to create fully-featured presentations for free. Presentations made with `reveal.js` are built on open web technologies. That means anything you can do on the web, you can do in your presentation.
