### Environment file

You need to use an env file to store environment variables () file with your MySQL database password to access MySQL.

env file to store environment variables. This file contains key-value pairs in the format KEY=VALUE , with each variable on a new line. We can use libraries like python-dotenv to load the variables from the file into our Python script automatically.


#### MacOS

1. [Download the `env` file](/.env) in your Downloads folder (the file is hidden)
2. Open Finder and navigate to the Downloads folder 
3. Move the file in your folder `lab-competitive`.
4. Open the file and replace `YOUR-PASSWORD` with your MySQL password.
5. Save the changes.
6. Rename the file from `env` to `.env` (this will hide the file)
7. To view hidden files, you need to press the “Command” + “Shift” + “.” (period) keys at the same time. The hidden files will show up as translucent in the folder.
8. If you want to obscure the files again, press the same “Command” + “Shift” + “.” (period) combination.
